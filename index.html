        <p>A programming learning path is a plan or guide that is established to acquire skills and knowledge in a specific area of programming. This path may include a series of courses, tutorials, projects and exercises that must be completed in a specific order to ensure effective learning progress.</p>
        <p>Learning paths can be created by individuals, organizations, or online teaching platforms, and are designed to help students learn effectively and systematically. These paths can be specific to a technology, programming language, framework, platform, among others.</p>
        <p>Learning paths may also include tips and advice to help students develop additional skills, such as teamwork, problem solving, and effective communication. The idea is that students have a clear guide to what they need to learn and how they can advance on their path to becoming competent programmers.</p>
        <p>The number of learning routes in programming can vary depending on how the teaching is focused and the objectives to be achieved. However, several common learning paths can be found, such as:</p>

      <header>Front-End</header>
      <article>
        <p>The Front-End is the visible and accessible part of a web page, that is, everything that is shown to the user in their browser. Front-End developers work with technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create attractive and functional user interfaces.</p>
        <p>To be a Front-End Developer you must have knowledge of these languages, frameworks and libraries:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML: The markup language used to structure the content of web pages.</li>
          <li>CSS: The styling language used to format and design web pages.</li>
          <li>JavaScript: The programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.</li>
          <li>React: A JavaScript framework used for creating component-based user interfaces (UI).</li>
          <li>Angular: A JavaScript framework used to create single page web applications (SPA) and hybrid mobile applications.</li>
          <li>Vue.js: A JavaScript framework used for creating component-based and reactive user interfaces (UI).</li>
          <li>jQuery: A JavaScript library that simplifies event handling, animations, and DOM manipulation.</li>
          <li>Bootstrap: A CSS framework that provides a set of predefined components and styles to facilitate the development of responsive websites.</li>
          <li>Sass: A CSS preprocessor that allows you to write CSS more efficiently by using variables, functions and mixins.</li>
          <li>Less: A CSS preprocessor that also allows you to write CSS more efficiently by using variables, functions and mixins.</li>

      <header>Back-End</header>
      <article>
        <p>The Back-End is the part of a web application that runs on the server and handles the application logic, database, authentication and security, communication with other systems, and more. It is responsible for receiving, processing and sending information to and from the user interface (front-end) and the database.</p>
        <p>To be a Back-End Developer you must have knowledge of these languages, frameworks and libraries:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PHP: It is one of the most popular languages for web development. It is used to build dynamic and scalable web applications.</li>
          <li>Python: It is a very popular programming language due to its simplicity and ease of use. Python is used in the development of web applications, data analysis, machine learning, among others.</li>
          <li>Ruby: It is a programming language used in web development and mobile application development.</li>
          <li>Java: It is a programming language widely used in the development of business and desktop applications. It is also used in web development.</li>
          <li>JavaScript: It is a programming language used in front-end and back-end development of web applications. It is one of the most popular languages today.</li>
          <li>Node.js: It is a framework used for the development of web applications in JavaScript. Node.js allows developers to create high-speed and scalable web applications.</li>
          <li>Laravel: It is a PHP framework that is used for the development of web applications and web systems. Laravel is known for its ease of use and wide range of features.</li>
          <li>Ruby on Rails: It is a Ruby framework used for developing web applications. Ruby on Rails is known for its ease of use and focus on convention over configuration.</li>
          <li>Spring: It is a Java framework that is used for the development of business applications and web systems. Spring is known for its wide range of features and focus on modularity.</li>
          <li>Express.js: It is a Node.js framework used for developing web applications. Express.js is known for its ease of use and focus on building high-speed, scalable web applications.</li>

      <header>Full-Stack</header>
      <article>
        <p>Full-Stack development refers to the ability to work on both the client side (front-end) and the server side (back-end) of a web application. A Full Stack developer can work on all layers of a web application, from the user interface to the database and server layer.</p>
        <p>To be a Full Stack Developer you must have knowledge of these languages, frameworks and libraries:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Programming Fundamentals: As in Front-End, it is important to have a solid foundation in programming. This includes understanding concepts such as variables, functions, data structures, control flow, and algorithms.</li>
          <li>HTML and CSS: Although these technologies are mainly used for the Front-End part, it is important to have a good knowledge of them as a Full-Stack developer to be able to build and design user interfaces.</li>
          <li>JavaScript: This language is essential for both Front-End and Back-End. It is important to know it well and understand its main concepts such as object-oriented programming, higher-order functions, asynchronism, and DOM manipulation.</li>
          <li>Front-End Frameworks: As in Front-End, there are several frameworks that can accelerate web application development. The most popular are React, Angular and Vue.js.</li>
          <li>Database: To build complete applications, you need to know how to work with databases. It is important to know the fundamentals of SQL and have experience with a database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB.</li>
          <li>Back-End Frameworks: To build the Back-End of an application, there are several popular frameworks in different programming languages. Some examples are Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), and Laravel (PHP).</li>
          <li>APIs: APIs are an important part of web application development. You need to know how to build and consume RESTful APIs and how to work with data exchange formats such as JSON and XML.</li>
          <li>Authentication and authorization: It is important to know the concepts of authentication and authorization to secure web applications. You need to know how to handle passwords and access tokens, and how to implement roles and permissions.</li>
          <li>Deployment and maintenance: To deploy a web application in production, you need to know DevOps concepts, have experience with deployment tools such as Docker, and know how to maintain and update the application.</li>
          <li>Testing and debugging: Finally, it is important to know how to perform unit and integration testing, as well as debugging web applications. You need to have experience with tools like Jest and Postman.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Full Stack developers can work in various areas, such as web application development, mobile application creation, enterprise software development, among others. Some of the skills required to be a Full Stack developer include the ability to solve problems, teamwork, attention to detail, and the ability to learn new technologies.</p>
